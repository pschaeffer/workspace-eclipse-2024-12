/**
 * Class for building complex sets of strings (such as a program)
 *
 * Each instance of this class is used to build a set of complex strings.
 * For example, one instance of this class might be used to build a full
 * JavaScript program. Each instance has the accumulated text (so far)
 * and the current indentation level. The class instance methods keep
 * track of the current indentation level.
 *
 * Note that the indentation code is no longer really in use. The caller
 * must provide properly indented code.
 *
 * @version 1.0
