/* The enum below defines the types of editors this code can be 
	 used for. This code can be used to build and run a modifications
	 editor, a proxy definition editor, a run-time configuration
	 editor, an authentication editor, and ignore-lists editor,
	 and a store (stored value) editor. All six types of editors 
	 are valid.
	 
	 Note, that at present nine (9) types of editors have been 
	 devised. Additional editor types can be added as need be.
	 
	 This code can also be used to run the pass-through mechanism.
	 The pass-through mechanism is not generally an editor (with 
	 at least one exception). However, the editor machinery is 		
	 used to make the pass-through mechanism work. 	  
	  
	 This code was originally used to build and run the 
	 modifications editor. It is now used to build and run several 
	 different types of editors. A global value is used to control 
	 the current editor type in the JavaScript code (but not in the
	 Java code). */
