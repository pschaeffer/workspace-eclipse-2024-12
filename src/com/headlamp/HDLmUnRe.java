/**
 * Class for supporting undo and redo processing.      
 * 
 * Zero for any field means that no undo/redo operation 
 * has been recorded
 * 
 * The JavaScript comments for HDLmUnRe.js may be helpful
 * in understanding this code
 * 
 * Send messages to all Java instances telling them to reload the rules
 *   from the database 
 * Consider the multi-user case. Undo should apply to the current user.
 *   Not all the users.
 * insertTableRows may not be passed company and other things 
 * If more than one party is making change, than an undo operation
 *   my fail (at least in part)
 * We need memory barriers in the multi-user case (perhaps we should
 *   use volatile, locks, or synchronized)

	   This value can be much less than the highest numbered undo/redo

	   ations are undone, then the current value will be (re)set to 
	   zero, showing that there is nothing left to be undone. Second,
	   say 40 undo/redo operations are recorded. 20 operations are then
	   undone. This will cause the current value to be set to 20. If 
	   a new undo/redo operation is recorded, then the top and current 
	   numbers will be (re)set to 21. As a practical matter some 20
