/**
 * Class for tracking the status of each thread
 * 
 * Instances of this class are definitely created. Each instance
 * has information about the status of a thread at some point in
 * time.
 * 
 * This class also has a static field for the overall concurrent
 * thread status map. The concurrent thread status map is created 
 * just once, but is updated as need be. 
 * 
 * The key value is the thread name such as qtp512456259-109. The
 * data value is the thread status at some time. This means that
 * only the newest thread status for a given thread is tracked in
 * the concurrent hash map. Another way of saying this, is that a 
 * new status for a given thread, will replace the old status. 
 * 
 * The status map used by this class is completely hidden internally and
 * never exposed. No method exposes the status map and/or returns a reference
 * to the status map. All methods use the concurrent hash map and are not
 * synchronized. 
 *  
 * @version 1.0
