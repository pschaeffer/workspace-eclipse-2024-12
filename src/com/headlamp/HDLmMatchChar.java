	   Note that any character can be escaped (using a backslash). Any
	   escaped character represents itself. This rule includes escape
	   itself. If a backslash is preceded by another backslash, then
	   the two characters represent a single literal backslash. One
	   consequence is that a single backslash can not be the last
	   character of an input string. */
