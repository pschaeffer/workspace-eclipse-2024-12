/**
 * Class for supporting the tree of nodes
 *
 * Each instance of this class describes one node in the node tree. The top
 * level node is called the top node. The top node has subnodes for each
 * company. Of course, the top node may have zero, one, or more than one company
 * subnodes. If the pass-through editor is in use, then the top node will have
 * exactly two subnodes. They are 'Companies' (without the quotes) and 'Reports'
 * (without the quotes).
 * 
 * if the pass-through editor is in use, then each company wiil be a subnode of
 * the 'Companies' (without the quotes) node.
 *
 * Each company node has zero or more subnodes. Each subnode of a company node
 * is a division node if the pass-through editor is not in use. The number of
 * division nodes may be zero or greater than zero.
 * 
 * If the pass-through editor is in use, then each company node, will have
 * exactly four subnodes. They are 'Data', 'Ignore Lists', 'Reports', and
 * 'Rules' (all without the quotes). Of course, in this case, division nodes
 * are subnodes of the Rules node and also subnodes of the Data node.
 *
 * Each division node has zero or more subnodes. Each subnode of a division node
 * is a site node. The number of site nodes may be zero or greater than zero.
 *
 * Each site node has zero or more subnodes. Each subnode of a site node is a
 * modification node. The number of modification nodes may be zero or greater
 * than zero.
 *
 * In all cases, child nodes are stored in the children array. Child nodes must
 * always be in ascending name order. This order must be maintained when new
 * child nodes are inserted into the children array.
 *
